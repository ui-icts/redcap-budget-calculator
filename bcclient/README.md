# Dashboard SPA

This is the Single Page Application for the CCTS Dashboard web app. It is written using `react-router-bootstrap`.

The main service for this app uses Spring Boot. See the main [Read Me](../../../README.md) for more information about the Java Spring Boot portion of this applications.

# ReactJS

The SPA was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run spring-build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. Then, copies the `build` directory to Spring Boot's `static` directory for inclusion in the Spring Boot jar and use when Spring is run from an IDE.
